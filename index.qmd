HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Fabian, a data scientist and developer specializing in reliable machine learning.
This portfolio websites gives an overview of my projects and skills.


I graduated as M.Sc. in media technology with a special focus on cross-functional data science and reliable machine learning. In my Master thesis I advanced the research on uncertainty quantification for cross-validation scenarios. So I have a great understanding of performance estimation. Let's design ML solutions to be useful and reliable in both simple and critical applications. 
I love developing of statistical software. My audio engineering background helps me to think end-to-end and solve cross-functional and medial tasks. I am excited to tackle new interdisciplinary challenges with robust machine learning and statistics. Love developing, learning and evolving in a team.
