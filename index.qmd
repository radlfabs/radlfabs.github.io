## Fabian Rosenthal

*Data Scientist* <br><br>

With a M.Sc. in Media Technology, I specialize in developing robust machine learning solutions that perform reliably across simple and critical applications.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="200%,-30%" scale-by="5"}
##### Spezialization
My research on uncertainty quantification and cross-validation has equipped me with deep insights into performance estimation and statistical computing. This allows me to make data-driven decisions.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="150%,60%" scale-by="4"}
##### Projects
In my projects I like to incorporate my knowledge to build reliable solutions. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="150%,60%" scale-by="4"}
##### Projects
In this forecasting of bicycle demand in Cologne, I incorporated prediciton intervals to account for the uncertainty in the model. This gives more insights to the stakeholders and helps to make better decisions.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="350%,-210%" scale-by="10"}
##### Master thesis
In my thesis at Fraunhofer MEVIS I trained 4+ million models to find appropriate methods to get confidence intervals for cross-validation estimates. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="90%,-105%" scale-by="3"}
##### Master thesis
The complex study design allowed me to analyse the operation characteristics of statistical methods and to derive recommendations for the application in practice.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="150%,160%" scale-by="4"}
##### Programming
I loved the development of my package for complex cross-validation workflows: `flexcv`. It uses a class interface for setting up the experiments.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="0%,20%" scale-by="1.5"}
##### Work
`flexcv` originated in my work at Hochschule DÃ¼sseldorf where I cross-validated a lot. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="10%,130%" scale-by="3.5"}
##### Work
In my 3 years as a student research assistant I developed the ML pipelines that are used in a study on sound perception in private dwellings. I was also responsible for the processing and feature engineering of the 6000+ audio recordings of our study.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="-130%,140%" scale-by="3.5"}
##### Work and Bachelors
A comprehensive study on feature selection including 2000+ audio features was part of my Bachelor thesis. I presented my work at DAGA 2022 in Stuttgart.
:::


:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="-10%,40%" scale-by="2.5"}
##### Background
During my studies in audio and video engineering, I transitioned to a more data focused path.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="-110%,10%" scale-by="3"}
##### Background
Learning about machine learning in a project on music recommender systems at Hochschule DÃ¼sseldorf was a game changer for me and motivated me to pursue a career in data science.
:::

<!-- :::{focus-on="cr-panel" pan-to="-70%,-115%" scale-by="4"} -->
:::{focus-on="cr-words"}
##### Background
And on my journey I mastered a lot of languages, frameworks and tools.

:::{focus-on="cr-equation" scale-by="1"}
##### Background
My interdisciplinary backgroundâ€”spanning audio engineering and data scienceâ€”enables me to approach complex challenges with a holistic, end-to-end perspective. I'm passionate about working in cross-functional teams and collaborating with domain experts to deliver impactful solutions.
