HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Fabian, a data scientist bridging machine learning and engineering.

With a M.Sc. in Media Technology, I specialize in developing robust machine learning solutions that perform reliably across simple and critical applications. My research on uncertainty quantification and cross-validation has equipped me with deep insights into performance estimation and statistical computing. I love package development and open-sourced a Python package for complex cross-validation workflows.

My interdisciplinary backgroundâ€”spanning audio engineering and data scienceâ€”enables me to approach complex challenges with a holistic, end-to-end perspective. I'm passionate about working in cross-functional teams and collaborating with domain experts to deliver impactful solutions.
