I'm Fabian Rosenthal, a Data Scientist and developer. With my engineering background, I bring a cross-disciplinary perspective to data science. I am specialized in performance estimation and uncertainty quantification. In my work and university projects, I have proven the ability to identify the right tool for a problem, communicate it to the team, master it, and ship it quickly.
